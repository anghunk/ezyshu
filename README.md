A coder, likes to toss some technology, is still working + studying hard, and often records something in my personal blog, such as: programming notes or reading notes, etc., as long as I am interested, I will write it down. It can be regarded as increasing their own knowledge. 📖

My hobbies are games and music, and my favorite singer is Xu Song.
